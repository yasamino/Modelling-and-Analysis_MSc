## Overview

This repository contains the code, data, and analysis scripts used in the master's project supporting the paper *Living Capillary Bridges*.  

The goal of this work is to **model, simulate, and analyze the behavior of living capillary bridges** using computational methods. We use [CellSim3D](https://github.com/SoftSimu/CellSim3D), a coarse-grained software and model to simulate large-scale cellular systems in three dimensions. The scripts implement key parts of the analysis and visualization workflows.
